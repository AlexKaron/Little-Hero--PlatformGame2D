# Little-Hero--PlatformGame2D
My first platform game. Simple, but with a retro vibe. This is a good start to the further development of the classic Mario Bross-style game. Game made after 3 months of independent C # learning. The game is made during the udemy course, I used the assets available in the course (mainly the course by Rick Davidson) as well as public tutorials and my own ideas.
